# Ansible_Project
As a consultant at an E-Commerce based startup. I was asked to find a solution to automate the task related to setting up the environment required for the application to run. Currently the team is manually provisioning the environment whenever a new server is launched and this has slowed down the overall deployment process. The architecture group thinks that automating the tasks using Ansible will lead to faster provisioning. Task is to build a full-proof-concept.

# Jira Task-1:
As a consultant at Ansible Corp. The Engineering team has raised an issue. Whenever a new server is launched, the developers have to manually log in to the server and configure the application environment and deploy the application. This approach is a time-consuming task for the developers and also the overall software release cycle. They would like the entire application environment to be set up on a Linux server automatically with a single command. Task is to create an Ansible Playbook that can create the entire application environment for developers.

# Jira Task-2
As a consultant at Ansible Corp. I received a task from an Enterprise client. The DevOps team has been writing multiple playbook files for different sets of configurations and they run the playbooks one by one individually to configure the entire system. During the architecture review by the Ansible team, 
it has been recommended to use Ansible roles as a best practice. Since the customer is an Enterprise client, client has assigned me the task of analyzing the customer playbook files and refactoring them to Ansible roles.

# Jira Task-3
As a consultant at Ansible Corp. A member from a SysOps Team who is working with me from Enterprise customers is facing an issue.
The Ansible code that he has written is reported to have security and optimization issues. Being an Enterprise customer, client has assign he task of analyzing the customer code and optimizing and Securing it using Ansible best practices.
