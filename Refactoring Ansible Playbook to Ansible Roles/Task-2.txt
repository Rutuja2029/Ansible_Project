Jira Task:

As a Technical Support Engineer at Ansible Corp. 
You have received a new support case from an Enterprise client. 
The DevOps team has been writing multiple playbook files for different sets of 
configurations and they run the playbooks one by one individually to configure 
the entire system. During the architecture review by the Ansible team, 
it has been recommended to use Ansible roles as a best practice. 
Since the customer is an Enterprise client, 
boss has assigned you the task of analyzing the customer playbook files 
and refactoring them to Ansible roles.
